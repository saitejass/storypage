<p6>The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is an Indian single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather fifth-generation stealth, multirole combat aircraft being developed for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy. The Mark-1 variant of the aircraft will be a fifth generation fighter while the Mark-2 variant will have sixth-generation technologies.The aircraft is designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) - an aircraft design agency under MoD. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) consisting of ADA, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and a private company is being formed for the development and production of AMCA.In March 2024, the project received approval from India's Cabinet Committee on Security for the prototype development.

    AMCA is designed as a single-seat, twin-engine combat aircraft. The AMCA Mark 1 will come equipped with 5.5 generation technologies and Mark 2 will have the incremental 6th generation technology upgrades. The AMCA is intended to perform a multitude of missions including Air supremacy, Ground-Strike, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Electronic Warfare (EW) missions. It is intended to supplant the Sukhoi Su-30MKI air superiority fighter, which forms the backbone of the IAF fighter fleet.

    The AMCA design is optimized for low radar cross section and supercruise capability.Feasibility study on AMCA and the preliminary design stage have been completed, and the project entered the detailed design phase in February 2019. The AMCA is currently the only 5th generation fighter under development in India.

       <h4 style="background-color: chartreuse;"> STEALTH:</h4> The 25-tonne twin-engine aircraft, which will be bigger than other fighters in the Indian Air Force inventory, will have advanced stealth features to avoid detection by enemy radar. Dr Krishna Rajendra Neeli, project director of AMCA at ADA, said the aircraft would be on par or even superior to other fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft in use globally.
    </p1>
    <p1>
       <h4 style="background-color: chartreuse;"> FUEL & WEAPONS:</h4> The aircraft will have a large, concealed internal fuel tank of 6.5-tonne capacity, and an internal weapons bay for a range of weapons, including indigenous weapons, to be buried in its belly.
    </p1>
    <p1>
       <h4 style="background-color: chartreuse;"> ENGINE:</h4> The AMCA Mk1 variant will have the US-built GE414 engine of the 90 kilonewton (kN) class, while the more advanced AMCA Mk2 will fly on the more powerful 110kN engine, which will be developed indigenously by DRDO’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) in collaboration with a foreign defence major. India has been talking with Safran SA of France, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aircraft engines and related equipment, in order to finalise the roadmap for the development of the combat aircraft engine.Other features such as a diverterless supersonic inlet for controlling air flow into the engines, and a serpentine air intake duct to shield the engines from radar emissions, are likely to be part of the AMCA.
